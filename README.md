Framework is based on Page Object Design pattern using TestNG
In order to run the test classes, we can simple run it through testng.xnml or by navigating to individual test classes as well.

Maven is used as build tool & for dependency management, hence we can also run the project through terminal using maven command "mvn clean test -DsuiteXmlFile=testng.xml" 

These tests were carried out on MacOS with chrome browser 106 (latest stable version)
